                <p>&emsp;&emsp;As I pulled up to my friend‚Äôs house for the first time, two things jumped out to me. They weren‚Äôt in the best neighborhood, some would call it ‚Äúsketchy‚Äù. The next thing is that the entire left side of their porch was filled with boxes and crates. They invited me in, and I noticed that the front room was taken up almost completely by more boxes. As I hung out with my friend, I kept on focussing in on the boxes there, and as I got a closer look, I noticed that many of the boxes said things like ‚ÄúChurch Welfare Services‚Äù. I later talked to my friend‚Äôs mom and she told me that she gets welfare resources from the church, even though she isn‚Äôt a member, and puts them out on her porch and any homeless or those in need can come and take resources.  According to the US Office of Human Services Policy, ‚ÄúMore than one in four working-age adults (27 percent) and nearly one of every two children (49 percent) participated in a safety net program.‚Äù in 2019. This is something that should be on our minds because that is a large portion of the population using and being a part of programs such as housing assistance, food security programs, and other welfare programs. Should it be the government providing these services? I think so. Government for the people, by the people, should be helping the people. Yet, time after time, private aid far outpaces government welfare.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;When my grandpa‚Äôs family was living in nazi-occupied land during WWII, they went hungry constantly. There was a severe lack of food. The US government was sending food shipments, but my ancestors never got any of that. The food that the Americans were sending got caught up in travel and political logistics. It was the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saint‚Äôs food shipments that saved my family. The government that was supposed to be the one getting them out of there, but the paths that the government set up were confusing and there were thousands of others trying to get through the slow bureaucratic process. It was only with the Church‚Äôs assistance that my grandparents were able to move to America (on July 4th coincidentally, God Bless America ü¶Ö). Welfare has been something my family has always been familiar with.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Growing up, I had always been told by my mom that some of the food in our house was from the ‚Äúfood bank‚Äù. Last year I went with her to pick up some food. As we pulled into the parking lot, I noticed that this didn‚Äôt look like the food bank that I had volunteered at previously. As I walked up to the glass doors, a smiling man in a suit exiting the building welcomed me. When I stepped in, the building looked exactly like countless others I had been in throughout my life. It was a community food bank being run out of a local church building. There were missionaries handing out food, not food bank volunteers. Pictures of Jesus littered the walls (God Bless America ü¶Ö). The food was from donations from the church community, not from any government backed organization.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Stories like this are not uncommon in Utah. According to NPR, ‚Äúthe state [of Utah] has gotten out of spending $75 million on poverty that it otherwise would have been required to under federal law‚Äù because of the welfare done by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Because of this, the state of Utah is providing many less services than what a government usually would and should be doing. The State of Utah has been counting welfare done by the Church towards their legal obligation, and this is a problem. If someone isn‚Äôt a part of a faith, there is the opportunity for them to potentially not get help that they need. That usually doesn‚Äôt happen, but the government should be providing their own welfare that should be open to anyone, regardless of religion, or any other personal identifier. I think it is great we have private organizations that help people, but why is the government being so incompetent that private organizations have to step in?</p>

                <p style="text-align:center;">Speech of a Concerned Citizen</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Hello representatives and members of the Salt Lake City Council, thank you for this opportunity to talk to you today. I stand before you as a concerned citizen, and I would like to talk about the impact of our city's welfare system. I think we can all agree that a functioning welfare system is necessary for a thriving city, because everyone needs that safety net to be able to get back on their feet.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;The Urban Institute reports that “Nearly all (97 percent) public welfare spending went toward operational costs in 2020, including payments to Medicaid providers, payments to nonprofits or other private providers of public services for low-income beneficiaries, and program administration.“ While these costs are necessary, it's clear that a significant portion of the funding intended for direct cash assistance to those in need is instead being used to keep the system running. This divergence of funds away from those who need it most is deeply concerning. It calls into question the effectiveness of our current welfare approach. For many beneficiaries of the welfare system, direct assistance is the most flexible way for them to receive assistance because it can be used on anything immediately without jumping through red tape to be able to spend it. Some may say that those given direct assistance will abuse it, but there are already systems such as WIC that already have that kind of system, and it has proven that there can be only a very small amount of abuse when there is correct oversight. When the welfare system treats the recipients with respect, the recipients will treat the system funds with respect.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;This issue is particularly concerning given the current state of poverty in our city. As noted by the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute in a report, Utah has the highest labor force participation rate among the United States. However, this statistic is troubling as the number of adults experiencing intergenerational poverty in Utah has been rising steadily, even with the proportionally most workers. According to a report by the Utah Department of Workforce Services, ”The number of adults experiencing intergenerational poverty in Utah is increasing. Since 2020, the adult population experiencing IGP grew by 14,740 people — a 20% increase from 2020 to 2021.” This surge in poverty is alarming, particularly as it affects multiple generations within the same families. This can create a vicious cycle of poverty where multiple people in a family are reliant on welfare, causing them to not be able to help each other.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;A study of Utah's welfare system by Mary Taylor, found that “Over a third of the sample (37%) reported that their lives had improved since their cases had closed. Of course, they did not always attribute this to case closure. Nonetheless, 56 respondents (14% of the sample) felt the closure of their cases had directly improved their lives.” This suggests that while some individuals may benefit from the transition out of the system, many others are not finding the support they need to climb out of poverty. This highlights the need for a more effective system that empowers individuals and provides for a smoother transition out of welfare, when, and only when, it is possible for the individual to support themselves. I think it is very important for those within the system to be able to have a good experience that causes them to have the confidence to say that the welfare system helped them.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;I am calling for us to reevaluate our approach to welfare in Salt Lake City. It is important that we do not continue to spend the vast majority of our funds on administrative costs while so many of our residents struggle with poverty. It is clear that reform is needed so that more of the money intended for direct assistance actually reaches those in need. Prioritizing more funding and reallocation of funds towards direct cash assistance will allow for more people to use the welfare system more effectively. We should support and continue to use the “one door” policy, having just one simple entry point to welfare and workforce services.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;We also need to strengthen our efforts to help welfare recipients transition back into the workforce. This should include providing more comprehensive job training and placement services, as well as support for those facing barriers to employment such as those who have no permanent address. Getting employment requires more than being placed in a job, but also learning the skills that are needed to sustain long-term financial stability. Our welfare system has a responsibility to help those who apply to find resources to learn such skills.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;We must acknowledge that welfare is just one part of the way we should be addressing poverty. We need to work collaboratively with other city departments and community organizations to tackle the root causes of poverty and provide more full support to those in need. This includes addressing issues like housing instability, food insecurity, and access to healthcare.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;The welfare system was designed to be a safety net, but it is clear that it is currently failing many of the people it is meant to help. By taking action and reforming and changing how our welfare system works, we can ensure that our welfare programs are being effective, and that they help individuals and families break free from the cycle of poverty. This will require a commitment from all of us (the council, city staff, and the community) to work together and create real, lasting change.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;We should aim to have a system that recognizes the humanity and potential of every individual, that they are more than just a number, and that provides the support needed to help those in need rise above their circumstances. We should have a welfare system that allows anyone to have a chance at living their American dream.</p>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Thank you for your time listening to my speech, and a hope that the council will ponder and consider all that I have said. I am confident that by working together, we can create a Salt Lake City where everyone has the opportunity to have an acceptable standard of living. We can have a city where the welfare system works as a temporary help for those in need, and a stepping stone to a better future for all our residents.</p>

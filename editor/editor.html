                <p>Welfare is something that often runs in the background of our society. Sometimes poverty and by extension, the welfare system are purposely hidden away from the eye of the public to make a community look more well off than it is. I am passionate about welfare, and making it the best, most effective system that it can be. My hope is that you, whoever is reading this, thoroughly enjoy browsing my magazine and leave with a renewed interest in the welfare system in Utah.<br><br>

                    Why should you care? Leading you to care about a system that you likely haven’t had experience in and may think that you never will, is a hard task. I bet that someone you know has a story about welfare. Some people may not even talk about it because some see it as shameful to get ‘hand-outs’. As I read about much of the material out there on the subject of welfare, I noticed that sometimes those analyzing it get too caught up in the numbers, statistics, benefits, budgets, etc, while forgetting the human aspect of it. Welfare is deeply personal by nature, and I hope that as you read you remember the real everyday people that it affects. A half percent budget cut could be the difference of a family surviving and scraping by, or losing their house. <br><br>
                    
                    I think that public welfare is necessary, I think that private solutions and charities are great, but ultimately I think it is the government’s responsibility to provide an adequate level of living to all. The American Dream would not be possible if one does not have somewhere to start from. <br><br>
                    
                    My magazine has a variety of mediums. The information effect is a powerpoint, because whenever I think of information, I think of a presentation. My profile is a video because I think that when you want to connect with someone, it is vital that you see them and hear from them what they have to say. My memoir and persuasive pieces are written out because they have premises that have written text be the most sensical. The memoir is a memory written down, and the persuasive piece is a script to be read off of. <br><br>
                    
                    Welfare budgets and the way the system is run is very much a reflection of the time. The way the welfare system is right now is a reflection of the culture that we have, and it always will be derived from the public attitudes about poverty and welfare. Different cultures and countries treat welfare differently as such. A culture that values self determination and hard work, pulling yourself up by the bootstraps, is going to be more strict on criteria needed to get help. The reverse is true. With this taken into account, even if you aren’t in a position of power, or if you can’t vote, or even if you aren’t in Utah, your attitudes towards welfare are important, whatever they may be. If the public attitudes towards welfare change, so will the welfare systems. <br><br>
